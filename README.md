# Week-9-Project-Honeypot
Time spent: **18** hours spent in total
# Honeypot I Deployed
Honeypot that was deployed is Dionaea over HTTP
# Issues that I encountered
What I mostly struggled with was getting the admin console to work properly. It seems that I spent a lot of time trying to get this to work. After many attempts, I believe that I was not understanding the instructions correctly. 
# Summary of the data collected
What was first done was that I downloaded the gcloud tools. I believe the downloading and installing of the gcloud tools was the easiest part. Once I began to use the Google Cloud Platform I created an admin vm. Milestone 2 is where I ran into some problems, but when I got to change it to Couozu I was able to complete what I needed. I was then later not able to connect to the server, which seemed to be a common issue with my classmates.
